We welcome contributions of all kinds—bug fixes, features, documentation, and ideas!  

### 🔎 Finding an Issue
1. Go to the **Issues** tab in the repository.  
2. Look for issues with labels like **`good first issue`** or **`help wanted`**.  
3. Comment on the issue you’d like to work on:  
   > "I'd like to work on this issue."  
4. Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you (to avoid duplicate work).

## 🚀 Core Workflow

### 1️⃣ Fork the Repository
Click the **Fork** button on the top right of the repository page.  
This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

### 2️⃣ Clone Your Fork
Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/GEEK-ROOM-KIET
cd repository-name
```

### 3️⃣ Create a New Branch
Always create a new branch for your work (never commit directly to `main` or `dev`):

```bash
# Create a new branch and switch to it
git checkout -b feat/add-login-button
```

✅ Examples:
- For new features: `feat/add-login-button`
- For bug fixes: `fix/navbar-alignment-bug`

### 4️⃣ Make Your Changes
Make your changes locally, then commit them with a **clear and descriptive commit message**:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "feat: Add login button to the navbar"
```

```bash
git push origin feat/add-login-button
```

### Step 2: Open a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.
2. You’ll see a **Compare & pull request** option—click it.

❌ **Don’t create PRs to `main`** — use `dev` only.  
❌ **Don’t start work without being assigned** to an issue.  
❌ **Don’t ignore the PR template** (missing info may lead to PR closure).

✅ **Keep your fork synced** with upstream:

git pull upstream dev
git push origin dev
```

✅ **Write clear commit messages.**  
✅ **Be respectful and collaborative.**
